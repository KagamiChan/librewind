# librewind
Yet another wind turbine optimization tool.

The project is built for practicing my python programming skill, and it will remain far from completion for quite a long long time.

## Features
currently, librewind aims to realize main functionalities available in openwind (closed source)  community edition
- [ ] WRG(Wind Resource Grid) reading
- [ ] Wind turbine power curve and thrust curve reading
- [ ] WRG interpolation in smaller sectors and wind speed steps
- [ ] Wind turbine power curve interpolation and adjustment according to air density
- [ ] production per turbine
- [ ] wake effect loss
- [ ] wind field definition
- [ ] turbine setting option
- [ ] optimization
- [ ] visualization
